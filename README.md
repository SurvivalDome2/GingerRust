# GingerRust
A game engine made in Rust, because I got bored of C.

The documentation will be split into multiple readme files, inside of the docs folder. Each file will explain how to use the corresponding feature, and my thought process when making it. I will try my best to make them look nice, but I'm not that good with design, hence the experience with programming.

The game engine is named after my cat, Ginger. Gingey for short.
